    <main>
	   <p> I don't know what else to write about so I'm just going to write about what I've done today and what my plans for this week are.</p>
	   <p>So far today I've washed laundry, and made myself lunch (it was a pizza bagel, it was pretty good but definitely could've been better). I think next time I'm going to cut up some onions or peppers and put them on it.</p>
	   <p>My friend was supposed to come over and hang out, but she left early to go have dinner with her parents.
	   </p>
	   <p>This week I'm going to start studying for the midterms I have next week, they're both in pretty hard classes so I want to start studying early so I don't have to stay up studying for hours the night before.
